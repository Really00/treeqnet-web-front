      <h3 id="">Q:  Which percentiles indicate good quality ?</h3>
      
      
      <p> For some attributes, low values are good (adapter dimers or percentage of ribosomal RNA fragments) while for others higher numbers are better (microRNA yield,
         percentage of reads in the analysis, Phred Scores). For each attribute and sample we provide the percentile the value has in the background distribution (the reference corpus). 
         Therefore, for adapter-dimers, lower quartile values are good, while for microRNA yield upper quartile values would be desired. 
        However, in order to keep the color code coherent the ‘good quartile’ will always be displayed in green while ‘the bad quartile’ will appear in red</p>

      <h2> Customizing Opineo</h2>
      <p> Before you make any cusomization or even start using Opineo create a 'div' element
        and assign it some id. Now add references to necessary Javascrip files e.g.</p>
      <ul class="faq-ul">
        <li>A reference to latest jQuery library </li>
        <li>A reference to Opineo script file sudo nano opineo.js</li>
      </ul>
